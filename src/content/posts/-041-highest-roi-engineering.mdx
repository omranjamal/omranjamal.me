Here's an opinion piece of the list of technical skills, tools, and concepts I highly doubt engineers will
regret picking up. Of course AI could replace us all and every skill we learn becomes useless, but hey...

# TL;DR

The list.

1. Asynchronous Programming (the nitty gritty)
2. Thread Synchronization: Locks, Events, Semaphores & Conditions
3. (Postgre)SQL
4. Horizontal Scaling
5. Data Structures (note: Not algorithms)
6. Other Paradigms
7. OOP Design Patterns That No One Should Ever Use
8. Functional Programming Concepts (just the basics)
9. Computer Networks
10. Docker & Linux
