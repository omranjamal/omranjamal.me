# Should You Follow This?

You should only follow this guide if ...

1. You are using Ubuntu (or derivative distros)
2. You want to reduce pain and maximize joy when working in a team.
3. _(optional)_ You are an engineer at [FringeCore_](https://fringecore.sh/) **(this is an opinion piece)**

# 1. Install Docker

I would highly highly encourage the use of the [convenience script](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#install-using-the-convenience-script) to install Docker. I'm actually rather surprised more people aren't using this method of installation (maybe it's because it's not on top of [the list](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#installation-methods)).

```bash
# we don't want the installer to stick around.
cd /tmp

# ensure you have the right packages
sudo apt install curl

# this one get's the actual installer
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh

# this one installs it.
sudo sh get-docker.sh
```

# 2. Setup Docker Rootless

Using `sudo` every time you run a docker command is a pain, and often it makes it impossible
to automate sometimes.

## 2.1. Setup

```bash
# Ensure the dependencies are present.
sudo apt-get install uidmap docker-ce-rootless-extras -y

# Disable the system-wide daemon. (do you really need it on a dev machine?)
sudo systemctl disable --now docker.service docker.socket

# dockerd-rootless-setuptool.sh install
dockerd-rootless-setuptool.sh install
```

Hopefully the above commadns should just run as-is.

## 2.2. Ask Docker CLI to Use It

Open `~/.bashrc` in an editor. _(Yes, I use nano. Fight me.)_

```bash
nano ~/.bashrc
```

Paste this at the very end.

```bash
export PATH=/usr/bin:$PATH
export DOCKER_HOST=unix:///run/user/1000/docker.sock
```

Save and exit out of the eidtor with `Ctrl`+`O`, `Enter`, `Ctrl`+`X`.

## 2.3. Reload Your Terminal environments

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

# 3. Allow Privileged Ports

Who install nginx on the host machine anymore anyway.

```bash
# this one tells your system to allow it.
sudo setcap cap_net_bind_service=ep $(which rootlesskit)

# notice the lack of `sudo`
systemctl --user restart docker 
```

# 4. Start + Start-up

```bash
# start it right now
systemctl --user start docker

# at boot
systemctl --user enable docker
```

# 5. Enable Long Running Processes

That don't exit as soon as you close your terminal.

This section is copied directly from my [üêã Stop Rootless Docker From Exiting](/blog/005-keep-docker-rootless-alive) post.

## 4.1. Enable Linger

```bash
sudo loginctl enable-linger $USER
```

## 4.2. Edit systemd's Login Session Config

Open `/etc/systemd/logind.conf` in a privileged editor.

```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/logind.conf
```

Add this to the end.

```bash
UserStopDelaySec=infinity
KillUserProcesses=no
```

Then restart the docker service.

```bash
systemctl --user restart docker.service
```

# Done

Enough opinions on how to setup your environment for the day. Welcome to our team.
