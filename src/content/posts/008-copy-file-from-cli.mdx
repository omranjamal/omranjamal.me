Shout out to [StÃ©phane Chazelas](https://unix.stackexchange.com/users/22565/st%c3%a9phane-chazelas) and
[his answer](https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/53537/577063) to the Unix Stackexchange question 
[**"Copying files from command line to clipboard"**](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/53503/copying-files-from-command-line-to-clipboard).

They gave me a major big-brain moment, and through his answer I learned that there are [3 different kinds](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/ClipboardsWiki/)
of clipboards in X11, and also that there are [target](https://dev.to/thumbone/inspecting-the-clipboard-on-linux-3hb0) on copied values that
allow applications to extract only the copied values that are compatible with itself.

# Concept: Copying a File

> Note: I only just tested this with `nautilus` the default file manager on Ubuntu.

Copying files in the default file manager usually involves writing the absolute path of the file
to the clipboard with a specific format and to a specific target atom.

For ubuntu, the format is the following:

```
copy
file://[file path 1]
file://[file path 2]
file://[file path 3]
```

_Note: The `file://` part, effectively turning this into a proper URI is important._

The target is ...

```
x-special/gnome-copied-files
```

# Copying From The CLI

To achieve this, we will first install a cli utility that allows for messing around
with the clipboards. It's called `xclip`

```bash
sudo apt install xclip
```

Say to copy the file with the path `/tmp/tomato.txt`, we must then first create the format
that the system expects.

```bash
printf "copy\nfile:///tmp/tomato.txt\0"
```

_Note: The `\0` at the end there, removes all ambiguity as to where the file paths end._

We must then pipe the output of this `printf` command, to `xclip` with the proper
target atom selected.

```bash
printf "copy\nfile:///tmp/tomato.txt\0" | \
    xclip -i -selection clipboard -t x-special/gnome-copied-files
```

and done! You can now paste in your file manager.
