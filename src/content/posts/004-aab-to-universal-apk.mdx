Say for some reason you got yourself a [`.aab`](https://developer.android.com/guide/app-bundle) file on 
your hands when developing for Android and you want to test the app by installing it on your phone
 without going through PlayStore for whatever reasons.

It could be from Android Studio's build feature, or some cloud (or cli) app build service like Expo's EAS
it doesn't matter, as long as you have a [keystore](https://developer.android.com/training/articles/keystore) 
and the credentials to the said keysotre, you can convert it into a universal APK.

# You Need

1. The `java` command available on your command line `PATH`
2. The `.aab` that you hate (or love, idk).
3. The [Keystore](https://developer.android.com/training/articles/keystore) and Credentials to the Keystore.

# Download Google's Bundle Tool

To download the latest, go to the Releases Link on the repo, 
and download the latest `bundletool-all-[version].jar` jar file.

Link: [https://github.com/google/bundletool/releases](https://github.com/google/bundletool/releases)

You could just use the commandline though, and download the version what was used at the time
of this writing.

```bash
wget https://github.com/google/bundletool/releases/download/1.15.1/bundletool-all-1.15.1.jar -O ~/Downloads/bundletool.jar
```

# Generate The APK

```bash
java -jar ~/Downloads/bundletool.jar build-apks \
  --bundle=[BUNDLE_PATH] \ 
  --output=[APK_DIRECTORY]/[SOME_FILENAME].apk \ 
  --mode=universal \ 
  --ks=[KEYSTORE_PATH] \
  --ks-pass="pass:[KEYSTORE_PASSWORD]" \ 
  --ks-key-alias="[KEYSTORE_ALIAS]" \
  --key-pass="pass:[KEYSTORE_ALIAS_PASSWORD]"
```

1. The `.apks` extension probably feels really weird, but it's apparently necessary to be 
explicit that it will be an archive of files not just one apk file.
2. The `pass:` part of the passwords is important. Leave as-is, as the literal value
`pass:`
3. `--mode=universal` generates universal APKs, otherwise 
you'll get a zip file with multiple APKs for multiple architectures.


# Extract The `.apk` File

You will be left with a `.apks` file in the APK directory that you input in the command
above. This file is simply a `.zip` file with a different extension. You can rename it to a `.zip`
and use your a GUI tool to extract it.

You can also just use the commandline as such:

```bash
cd [APK_DIRECTORY]
unzip ./[SOME_FILE].apks
```
