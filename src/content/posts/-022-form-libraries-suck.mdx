# Where It's Coming From

1. I'm a TypeScript stan. Types are life.
2. I think form generators are great. Until they aren't.
3. I truly believe React has nothing to do with the web.
4. React can be performant enough; No need to mess with DOM through refs.
5. Opaque abstractions are inherently evil.
