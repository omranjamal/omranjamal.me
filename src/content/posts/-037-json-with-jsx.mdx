Here's the big secret, JSX isn't special and although React had a lot to do with the invention of
JSX, JSX isn't exclusive to React. JSX can be used to build any kind of tree in memory. In fact
you can customize exactly what will be returned from a JSX expression.

# JSX to JS

So we kinda know that in order to use JSX we must use Babel or TypeScript, so it follows that
JSX compiles down to raw JS. So what does it compile down to?

Here's an example ...

```jsx
function Test() {
  return <div>tomato</div>;
}
```

The above JSX code turns into the following ...

```js
function Test() {
  return React.createElement("div", null, "tomato");
}
```

The thing is, JSX doesn't even have to HTML. You see how `div` just turns into a string?
