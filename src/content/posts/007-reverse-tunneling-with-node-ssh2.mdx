# Foreword

Honestly I was absolutely blown away by the [`ssh2` library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ssh2) on npm.
The fact that someone actually went through the trouble and put in the hard work to re-implement the
[SSH protocol](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4253) in pure nodejs is mind boggling and amazlingly
cool.

Of course, as human wants are endless, I decided that I wanted to establish
[SSH tunnels](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/tunneling-example) with it.
Especially [reverse SSH tunnels](https://www.howtogeek.com/428413/what-is-reverse-ssh-tunneling-and-how-to-use-it/).

> For forward ssh tunnels (the usual one), I would recommend using [`ssh2-promise`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ssh2-promise)'s `addTunnel`
> method as it's a very clean and simple interface around raw `ssh2`.

# TL;DR?

Scroll to the end. Find the [Putting It All Together](#putting-it-all-together) section.

# Reverse SSH Tunnels

## First, Establish The Connection

Easy enough. `ssh2`'s documentation is great in this regard.

```javascript
import { Client } from "ssh2";

const client = new Client();

client.on("ready", () => {
  console.log("SSH CONNECTION: READY");
});

client.connect({
  host: "server.example.com",
  port: 22,
  username: "jogndoe",

  // probably best to use a ssh key here instead.
  password: "12345678",
});
```

It doesn't matter which authentication method you use, as long as it
established the connection correctly.

## Bring The Server Port here

It's nice of the mantainers to literally call it `forwardIn`. Add this
inside the `on('ready')` function so that we're not trying to issue forwarding commands
even before a connection is established.

```js
client.on("ready", () => {
  console.log("SSH CONNECTION: READY");

  client.forwardIn("" /* bind address */, PORT, (error) => {
    if (error) {
      throw error;
    }

    console.log(`LISTENING: server:${PORT}`);
  });
});
```

Note, that the bind address in an empty string. This is so that the server can decide
which interface to attach to, but if your [server allows it](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/tunneling-example#remote-forwarding), you may pass in the string
`0.0.0.0` instead to listen on all interfaces.

## Forward Connection Requests to a Local Server

### Start Listening For Connections

Also, a part of the documentation.

```js
client.on("tcp connection", (details, accept, reject) => {
  console.log("TCP: INCOMING", details);
});
```

Now, everytime a client tries to connected ot the server port, it should the listener
function to this event should trigger.

1. `details` contains information about the tcp connection being established.
2. `accept` is a function that takes no arguments, but when called, accepts the
   remote tcp connection and returns a nodejs socket stream.
3. `reject` is kinda self explanatory.

We'll obviously be using `accept()` but, the `details` object is quite useful too.
It contains information such as the port being connected to, which comes in handy
if we're establishing multiple port forward-ins.

### Forwarding

#### Import `Socket` from `net`

At the start of the file, add an import for node's internal package
that enable working with raw TCP sockets. The [`net` package](https://codeforgeek.com/nodejs-net-module/).

```js
import { Socket } from "net";
```

#### Establish the Local Connection First

Do this within the tcp connection listener, based on the success of this connection
we will `accept()` or `reject()` the remote tcp connection.

```js
client.on("tcp connection", (details, accept, reject) => {
  console.log("TCP: INCOMING", details);

  // Create the socket
  const tcpClient = new Socket();

  // Connect to a local port (change the first
  // two arguments to your requirement)
  tcpClient.connect(8080, "localhost", () => {
    console.log(`LOCAL TCP: CONNECTED`);
  });
});
```

#### Accept & Interconnect

If you have worked with [NodeJS streams](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/node-js-streams-everything-you-need-to-know-c9141306be93/), 
you should feel right at home with connecting streams together with `pipe()`.

```js
tcpClient.connect(8080, "localhost", () => {
  console.log(`LOCAL TCP: CONNECTED`);

  // Accept the remote stream
  const serverStream = accept();

  // Pipe the output of the remote stream to the
  // local stream's input.
  serverStream.pipe(tcpClient);

  // Pipe the output of the local stream to the
  // remote stream's input.
  tcpClient.pipe(serverStream);
});
```

#### Handle Errors

I mean, we don't want the entire node process to crash do we?

```js
tcpClient.on("error", (error) => {
  console.error(error);
});
```

# Putting It All Together

This should just work.

```javascript
import { Client } from "ssh2";
import { Socket } from "net";

const client = new Client();

client.on("ready", () => {
  console.log("SSH CONNECTION: READY");

  client.forwardIn("", PORT, (error) => {
    if (error) {
      throw error;
    }

    console.log(`LISTENING: server:${PORT}`);
  });
});

client.on("tcp connection", (details, accept, reject) => {
  console.log("TCP: INCOMING", details);

  const tcpClient = new Socket();

  tcpClient.connect(8080, "localhost", () => {
    console.log(`LOCAL TCP: CONNECTED`);

    const serverStream = accept();

    serverStream.pipe(tcpClient);
    tcpClient.pipe(serverStream);
  });

  tcpClient.on("error", (error) => {
    console.error(error);
  });
});

client.connect({
  host: "server.example.com",
  port: 22,
  username: "jogndoe",

  // probably best to use a ssh key here instead.
  password: "12345678",
});
```
